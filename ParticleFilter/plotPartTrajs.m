function plotPartTrajs(k, Xk, Xkmin1, Wk, j, bAlpha)
%PLOTPARTTRAJS Summary of this function goes here
%   Plots lines between ith sample of Xk and j(i)th sample of Xk-1. When 
%   repeated during a particle filter execution, this will produce particle 
%   trajectories illustration over time.
%
%   This function is intended to be passed as a function handle into your
%   particle filter function.
%
% Inputs:
%   k           time instance index
%   Xk          [n x N] N particles of dimension n to approximate p(x_k).
%   Xkmin1      [n x N] N particles of dimension n to approximate p(x_k-1).
%   Wk          [1 x N] Corresponding weights.
%   j           Index vector such that Xk(:,i) = Xkmin1(:,j(i))
