    %approxGaussianTransform takes a Gaussian density and a transformation 
    %function and calculates the mean and covariance of the transformed density.

    %Inputs
    %   MU_X        [m x 1] Expected value of x.
    %   SIGMA_X     [m x m] Covariance of x.
    %   F           [Function handle] Function which maps a [m x 1] dimensional
    %               vector into another vector of size [n x 1].
    %   N           Number of samples to draw. Default = 5000.

    %Output
    %   MU_Y        [n x 1] Approximated mean of y.
    %   SIGMA_Y     [n x n] Approximated covariance of y.
    %   ys          [n x N] Samples propagated through f
